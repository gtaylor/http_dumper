HTTP Dumper
===========

This is a super quick-and-dirty WSGI application that prints out a few
pieces of HTTP info (headers, GET/POST details). I've just implemented the
bare minimum needed for a work project, so this is woefully incomplete. Feel
free to fork and hack on it to fit your needs.

Installation and Usage

    $ pip install http_dumper
